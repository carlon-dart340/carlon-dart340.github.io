                    <p class="paragraphs">Hi! My name is Carlon Bute and I am 
                        currently a student at La Salle University. I grew up without 
                        even a dime sized amount of creativity in my bones, but I had 
                        a sister who was so creatve I could’nt even understand it. Her 
                        creativity began to rub off on me the more time I spent with her 
                        which led me to like the things that she liked. I was 
                        always into technology and she was into art, so having 
                        both of those interest inside me now I got into things like 
                        Photography and Digital Art. My goal is to use my editing and 
                        skills to show off how creative I can get, and break everyone’s 
                        expectations.</p>
